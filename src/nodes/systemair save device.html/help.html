<p>Represents a SystemAIR SAVE device, accessible via the IAM module acting as a TCP Modbus proxy.
    Pull requests are welcome for direct connection.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>
<p>Due to the relatively flaky nature of the IAM addon, and <code>node-red-contrib-modbus</code>'s
    relative inability to handle this flakiness, this node should be used to interact with the
    SystemAIR SAVE family of devices.</p>

<p>This configuration node is responsible for actually executing the read from – and write
    operations to – the individual <code>systemair register</code> nodes. You will find options
    such as <code>Concurrency</code>, <code>Max Backlog</code> and timeouts to fine-tune the
    communication behaviour.</p>

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

<dl class="message-properties">
    <dt>Protocol</dt>
    <dd>selects the communication protocol used.
        <ul>
        <li>Modbus TCP – uses the TCP transport for Modbus communication. Appropriate for IAM
                connected over the etherner cable.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Address</dt>
    <dd>specifies the address at which the gateway or the device can be found. Value depends on the
        Protocol chosen:
        <ul>
        <li>Modbus TCP – enter the IP or domain of the device, port, and the Modbus device ID.</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>Concurrency</dt>
    <dd>limits the number of operations that can be executed at the same time. Lower values can
        reduce the speed at which multiple registers are read, however too large a value might
        put the gateway in a state that makes it refuse any further connections.
    </dd>
    <dt>Max backlog</dt>
    <dd>sets the maximum number of requests that may wait to be executed. This limit might be
        reached if e.g. concurrency is too low to serve the number of register operations. Once
        this limit is reached, further operations are discarded.
    </dd>
    <dt>Overall timeout</dt>
    <dd>sets the time limit for handling a single message command sent to a register. Note that the
        timeout starts counting when the processing of the message begins, rather than the moment
        at which it is delivered to the register node. So the overall message processing time can
        exceed this timeout.
    </dd>
    <dt>Request timeout</dt>
    <dd>sets the time limit for handling a single modbus request. When this node is processing a
        message, it may retry the individual modbus operations multiple times in order to mitigate
        flakiness of the SystemAIR devices. This value should be set to be at least as long as
        the device needs to receive, process and respond to the modbus requests. You can also set
        this to a duration longer than the overall timeout to effectively disable the retry
        behaviour to an extent (the responses indicating that the device was busy would still
        initiate a retry attempt.)
    </dd>
